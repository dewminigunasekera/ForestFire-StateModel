# Forest Fire Modeling: A Statistical Mechanics Perspective

This repository contains a spatial-temporal analysis of forest fires in Portugal, with a critical evaluation of standard regression-based modeling. Using data visualization, coordinate-wise recurrence analysis, and insights from statistical mechanics, we argue that fire behavior exhibits state-transition characteristics that invalidate naive regression approaches.

## üß† Core Insight

- Fire area prediction is **not a regression problem**.
- Each coordinate experiences at most **one significant burn** ‚Üí indicating **fuel exhaustion**.
- Without fuel state data, the system becomes **partially observable** and **non-ergodic**.
- This approach bridges **environmental modeling, spatial statistics**, and **stochastic state theory**.
